# Current Status and Cleanup Plan

## Current Status

1. **Deployment Issue**: Railway deployment is failing at the health check stage with "service unavailable" errors.

2. **Current Implementation**:
   - Using `bootstrap-complete.sh` as the main startup script
   - Enhanced health check in `health.php` that returns HTTP 200 but provides diagnostics
   - Updated the Dockerfile to use PHP 8.1 and include procps for process monitoring
   - Configured railway.toml to use Dockerfile and proper health check settings

3. **Main Issue**: Apache server is not starting successfully or is starting but not serving requests.

   - Updated railway.toml configuration

9. **Documentation update (#038)**
   - Updated `project-structure.md` with all recent changes

## Main Problems to Solve

1. **Health Check Failures**: The application doesn't respond to health checks, causing deployment failures

2. **URL Redirect Issues**: The application redirects to port 8080 or localhost

3. **Deployment Confusion**: Too many overlapping files and approaches

## Cleanup Plan

1. **Simplify Script Structure**:
   - Keep only the most recent and comprehensive solutions
   - Remove deprecated/outdated approach files

2. **Files to Keep**:
   - `bootstrap-complete.sh`: Main startup script with all fixes
   - `health.php`: Advanced diagnostic health check
   - `Dockerfile`: Current Docker configuration
   - `railway.toml`: Current Railway configuration
   - `000-default.conf`: Apache VirtualHost configuration
   - `SIMPLE-FIX.md` and `project-structure.md`: Documentation

3. **Files to Remove/Archive**:
   - `bootstrap-patch.sh`, `bootstrap-end.sh`, `bootstrap-fix.sh`: Superseded by bootstrap-complete.sh
   - `permanent-url-fix.sh`: Functionality now in bootstrap-complete.sh
   - `railway-deployment-guide.md`: Now covered in project-structure.md

4. **Simplify Diagnostic Approach**:
   - Add more robust error handling to bootstrap-complete.sh
   - Ensure health.php always returns a valid HTTP response
   - Enhance logging to identify specific failure points

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Review logs in Railway**: Use the Railway dashboard to check deployment logs and health check errors

2. **Enhance health check**: Make sure health.php is as simple as possible while still being diagnostic

3. **Simplify bootstrap script**: Remove any unnecessary complexity from bootstrap-complete.sh

4. **Debug Apache startup**: Focus specifically on why Apache isn't starting or responding to requests

5. **Test minimal deployment**: Create a minimal deployment with just essential files to isolate the issue

## Useful Commands

```bash
# View Railway logs
railway logs

# Connect to Railway shell
railway connect

# Run a local Docker build to test
docker build -t faveo-test .
docker run -p 8080:80 faveo-test
```
