## Docker Configuration
The project uses Docker for containerization with the following key files:

### Dockerfile
- Base image: `php:8.2-apache`
- System dependencies:
  - libzip-dev
  - unzip
  - git
  - curl
  - npm
  - libpng-dev
  - libonig-dev
  - libxml2-dev
  - libc-client-dev
  - libkrb5-dev

### PHP Extensions
- pdo_mysql
- zip
- gd
- mbstring
- exif
- pcntl
- bcmath
- xml
- imap

### Build Process
1. System dependencies installation
2. PHP extensions configuration
3. Apache mod_rewrite enablement
4. Application files setup
5. Composer installation
6. Permissions configuration
7. Environment setup
8. Copy bootstrap script for runtime initialization
9. Node dependencies installation
10. Final permissions setup

### Bootstrap Script
The application uses a bootstrap script (`bootstrap.sh`) that runs at container startup:
1. Composer dependency management:
   - Clear composer cache
   - Install dependencies with multiple fallback options:
     - First attempt: `--no-dev --no-scripts --prefer-dist --optimize-autoloader --no-interaction`
     - Second attempt: `--no-dev --no-plugins --prefer-dist --no-progress --no-interaction`
     - Third attempt: `--no-dev --no-interaction`
   - Creates a flag file (`needs_composer_install`) if all installation attempts fail
   - Generate optimized autoloader with error handling
2. Directory initialization:
   - Create necessary Laravel storage directories (cache/data, sessions, views, app/public)
   - Set proper permissions for storage and cache
3. Laravel initialization:
   - Create .env file if not exists (from .env.example)
   - Create a health check endpoint for Railway (`/public/health.php`)
   - Create diagnostic scripts for database connection troubleshooting
4. Database connection configuration:
   - Auto-detect available MySQL connections (both internal and external)
   - Try multiple connection methods (internal hostname, external hostname, socket)
   - Use the first successful connection method
   - Create a smart failover system between connection methods
   - Generate configuration files based on the working connection
5. Environment detection and configuration:
   - Detect Railway environment via `RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT` variable
   - Extract connection details from MySQL_PUBLIC_URL if available
   - Configure database using Railway environment variables
   - Configure app URL based on Railway settings
   - Set Apache ServerName to suppress warning messages
   - Adjust Apache to use the correct PORT as specified by Railway
   - Fall back to local configuration if not in Railway environment
6. Start Apache server

### Known Issues
The bootstrap script handles the following errors:
- Facade root errors during artisan commands (bypassed using PHP direct file operations)
- Ambiguous class resolution warnings from Faveo codebase (these are expected)
- Apache server name warning (resolved by setting ServerName directive)
- Missing frontend asset files (now handled via webpack.mix.js improvements)
- MySQL hostname resolution issues (resolved using external hostname and port)

### Frontend Asset Management
The `webpack.mix.js` file includes the following improvements:
- Automatic creation of missing resources directories
- Creation of placeholder JS and CSS files if not present
- Use of relative paths to prevent build failures
- Disabled URL processing for CSS to reduce build errors

### Docker Compose
The `docker-compose.yml` file (without version attribute) defines two services:
- **faveo**: The main application container
  - Built from the local Dockerfile
  - Mapped to port 8080
  - Connected to the MySQL database
- **db**: MySQL 8.0 database
  - Persistent volume for data storage
  - Preconfigured with database name, user, and password

    - Added `memory-only-fix.php` that configures database without writing files
    - Created `run-migrations-memory.php` that runs all setup steps without file access
    - Implemented Excel dependency stub generation to avoid package installation errors
    - Used $_ENV, putenv() and $GLOBALS for in-memory configuration instead of file writes
    - If you encounter permission errors:
      1. Visit `/public/memory-only-fix.php` to verify database connection
      2. Visit `/public/run-migrations-memory.php` to run migrations in memory
      3. If Excel dependency is causing issues, the memory script includes automatic stub generation

16. Artisan Command Failures
    - Issue: All artisan commands fail with error code 255 during migration
    - Solution: Created `direct-migration.php` that bypasses Laravel completely
    - This script creates essential database tables using direct SQL statements
    - Sets up a minimal admin user and basic system configuration
    - Uses PDO for direct database access without Laravel dependencies
    - Requires the memory-only-fix.php to establish database connection
    - Resolves common issues with required fields by providing default values
    - Implements proper error handling with detailed SQL error reporting
    - Automatically detects and uses the correct application URL

    - If user creation fails when using direct-migration.php, check the error message for:
      - Missing required fields
      - Constraint violations
      - Data type mismatches

18. Laravel Facade Root Error
    - Issue: "A facade root has not been set" error when accessing the application
    - Solutions:
      - Visit `/public/diagnose-facade.php` to run diagnostics and apply fixes
      - Use `/public/fix-bootstrap.php` to patch index.php and fix permissions
      - Ensure bootstrap-app.php is included at the beginning of index.php
      - Try accessing the application through `/public/alt-index.php`
      - Check that storage and bootstrap/cache directories have proper permissions
      - Clear Laravel configuration cache if needed

19. Composer Dependency Installation Failures
    - Issue: Vendor files missing or incomplete after deployment causing "Class not found" errors
    - Solution: 
      - Enhanced bootstrap.sh with multiple installation attempts and fallback options
      - Created install-dependencies.php for web-based dependency installation
      - Added a flag mechanism to detect and report failed installations
      - Integrated with diagnose-facade.php for automatic detection and guidance
      - Clear error reporting and detailed logs of installation process
    - The system now provides a self-healing mechanism for dependency issues:
      1. If installation fails during bootstrap, a flag file is created
      2. diagnose-facade.php detects this flag and shows a prominent message
      3. User can easily run install-dependencies.php to fix the issues
      4. After successful installation, the flag is automatically removed

5. Be aware of the ambiguous class resolution warnings (they're expected)
6. Test your changes locally before deploying to Railway
7. Use the provided database maintenance scripts when deploying to new environments
8. If encountering facade root errors, use the diagnostic tools provided

## Deployment
The project is configured for deployment on Railway with the following considerations:
- Environment variables must be properly set in the Railway dashboard:
  - MySQL connection variables are automatically set when linking MySQL service
  - APP_URL (for application URL)
  - PORT (automatically provided by Railway)
- The health check path is set to `/public/health.php` in railway.toml
- The start command is set to `/usr/local/bin/bootstrap.sh` to ensure proper initialization
- The bootstrap script automatically configures Apache to use the correct port
- After deployment, follow these steps:
  1. Visit `/public/diagnose-facade.php` to check the application status
  2. If Laravel classes are missing, visit `/public/install-dependencies.php` to install dependencies
  3. Visit `/public/run-migrations.php` to set up the database
  4. Visit `/public/repair-database.php` to verify and fix database structure
  5. Visit `/public/create-admin.php` to create an admin user
  6. Visit `/public/fix-permissions.php` to fix any permission issues
  7. Access Faveo at `/public` and log in with your admin credentials
- If you encounter permission issues during setup, use the memory-only alternatives:
  1. Visit `/public/memory-only-fix.php` to configure the database in memory
  2. Visit `/public/run-migrations-memory.php` to run migrations without file access
- If all artisan commands fail with error code 255, use the direct migration tool:
  1. Visit `/public/direct-migration.php` to set up the database directly without Laravel
  2. This script will create essential tables and an admin user automatically
  3. It handles issues with required fields and provides detailed error reporting
  4. The system settings will automatically use the correct application URL
- If you encounter facade root errors:
  1. Visit `/public/diagnose-facade.php` to diagnose and fix facade-related issues
  2. Visit `/public/fix-bootstrap.php` to patch index.php and fix permissions
  3. If the main application still doesn't work, try `/public/alt-index.php` as an alternative entry point
- If you encounter persistent issues:
  - Check Railway logs for specific error messages
  - Visit `/public/db-connect-fix.php` to diagnose and fix database connection issues
  - Visit `/public/db-test.php` to see detailed connection diagnostics

## Testing
- Unit tests should be run before deployment
- Integration tests for critical paths
- Environment-specific test configurations

## Maintenance
Regular maintenance tasks:
1. Update dependencies
2. Clear caches
3. Check storage permissions
4. Verify environment configurations
5. Run `/public/repair-database.php` periodically to check database integrity

## Security Considerations
1. Environment variables protection
2. File permissions management
3. Dependency security updates
4. API key management
5. Change default admin credentials immediately after installation

## Performance Optimization
1. Composer autoload optimization
2. Asset compilation
3. Cache configuration
4. Database optimization

## Troubleshooting
Common issues and solutions:
1. Dependency conflicts: Run `composer clearcache` followed by `composer update`
2. Permission issues: Check directory permissions for storage and bootstrap/cache
3. Cache issues: Use direct file operations to clear Laravel cache files
4. Environment issues: Verify .env configuration matches expected environment variables
5. Docker build issues: Use `docker-compose down` followed by `docker-compose up --build`
6. Laravel facade errors: 
   - Visit `/public/diagnose-facade.php` to diagnose and fix facade root issues
   - Make sure bootstrap-app.php is included at the beginning of index.php
   - Try accessing the application through alt-index.php
   - If issues persist, check storage and bootstrap/cache directory permissions
7. Railway deployment issues:
   - Verify health check is configured to use `/public/health.php` in railway.toml
   - Ensure start command is set to `/usr/local/bin/bootstrap.sh` in railway.toml
   - Verify database credentials are set correctly in Railway environment variables
   - Check logs for any container startup errors
   - Ensure the PORT environment variable is being respected by your container
8. Apache server name warnings: These are now suppressed by setting ServerName directive in the bootstrap script
9. Database connection issues in Railway:
   - Ensure you have added a MySQL plugin in the Railway dashboard
   - **CRITICAL**: You must explicitly link your MySQL service to your app service in Railway:
     1. Go to your Railway dashboard
     2. Select your app service
     3. Go to the "Variables" tab
     4. Click "Connect" or "Link Service" and select your MySQL service
     5. This ensures the environment variables are shared between services
   - If MySQL hostname resolution fails, use the diagnostic tools:
     1. Visit /public/db-connect-fix.php to automatically fix connection issues
     2. Visit /public/db-test.php to see detailed connection diagnostics
   - If automatic fixes don't work, manually set the correct hostname/port:
     - Use yamabiko.proxy.rlwy.net (or your specific external hostname) instead of mysql.railway.internal
     - Use the external port (52501 or your specific port) instead of the default 3306
   - The updated bootstrap.sh will automatically try both internal and external connections
10. Dockerfile build errors:
    - If you see error code 127 during the build process, it might be related to the bootstrap script
    - Use the external bootstrap.sh file approach instead of inline script creation

11. Environment File Issues:
    - Issue: The .env file might not be properly updated using sed commands
    - Solution: Use direct file writing with cat heredoc syntax instead of sed replacements
    - Use db-test.php to diagnose .env file loading issues and check file permissions

12. Railway MySQL Connection Issues:
    - Issue: mysql.railway.internal hostname not resolving in Railway environment
    - Solutions:
      - Ensure MySQL plugin is properly linked to your app service
      - Use the external hostname and port from MYSQL_PUBLIC_URL environment variable
      - The updated bootstrap.sh now automatically tries both internal and external connections
      - Visit /public/db-connect-fix.php to automatically fix connection issues

13. Database Initialization Issues:
    - Issue: Empty database after deployment
    - Solution: Use the provided scripts in order: run-migrations.php, repair-database.php, create-admin.php, fix-permissions.php
    - If scripts fail with permission errors, run `chmod 755 /var/www/html/public/*.php` in the Railway shell

14. PHP Version Compatibility:
    - Issue: Syntax errors due to newer PHP features used in scripts
    - Solution: Added backward compatible `db-fixed.php` file that works on older PHP versions

      3. If Excel dependency is causing issues, the memory script includes automatic stub generation

16. Artisan Command Failures
    - Issue: All artisan commands fail with error code 255 during migration
    - Solution: Created `direct-migration.php` that bypasses Laravel completely
    - This script creates essential database tables using direct SQL statements
    - Sets up a minimal admin user and basic system configuration
    - Uses PDO for direct database access without Laravel dependencies
    - Requires the memory-only-fix.php to establish database connection
    - Resolves common issues with required fields by providing default values
    - Implements proper error handling with detailed SQL error reporting
    - Automatically detects and uses the correct application URL
    - If you encounter artisan command failures:
      1. Visit `/public/direct-migration.php` to set up the database directly
      2. After setup completes, continue with standard admin user creation
      3. Change the default admin password immediately after login

17. Database Field Constraint Issues
    - Issue: User creation fails with errors like "Field 'ext' doesn't have a default value"
    - Solution: Updated schema definitions in direct-migration.php to include:
      - Default values for all required fields
      - Modified field definitions for better compatibility
      - Enhanced error reporting to show specific constraint violations
    - Fields like ext, country_code, and phone_number now have appropriate defaults
    - Improved error handling shows the exact SQL state and error codes
    - If user creation fails when using direct-migration.php, check the error message for:
      - Missing required fields
      - Constraint violations
      - Data type mismatches
      
18. Laravel Facade Root Error
    - Issue: "A facade root has not been set" error when accessing the application
    - Solutions:
      - Visit `/public/diagnose-facade.php` to run diagnostics and apply fixes
      - Use `/public/fix-bootstrap.php` to patch index.php and fix permissions
      - Ensure bootstrap-app.php is included at the beginning of index.php
      - Try accessing the application through `/public/alt-index.php`
      - Check that storage and bootstrap/cache directories have proper permissions
      - Clear Laravel configuration cache if needed

19. Missing or Incomplete Vendor Files
    - Issue: Laravel classes not found, "Class not found" errors after deployment
    - Solutions:
      - Visit `diagnose-facade.php` which will automatically detect the issue
      - Use `install-dependencies.php` to reinstall all dependencies
      - For command line access: `composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader`
      - Check for the `needs_composer_install` flag in public directory, which indicates bootstrap installation failure
      - If dependency installation fails repeatedly, check for memory limits or disk space issues

### Memory-Only Fix Solution
The project includes a special set of memory-only tools to handle deployment environments with restricted file permissions:

### memory-only-fix.php
A zero-footprint database configuration helper that:
- Works entirely in memory without writing any files to disk
- Avoids permission errors common in restricted deployment environments
- Tests multiple connection methods (Environment Variables, Railway Variables, DATABASE_URL, Railway Internal, .env File)
- Sets database configuration directly in memory using $_ENV, putenv() and $GLOBALS
- Provides detailed diagnostic information through a web interface
- Returns connection results for use in other scripts
- Shows database tables when connection is successful

### run-migrations-memory.php
A memory-only version of the migration script that:
- Uses the memory-only configuration helper to avoid file permission issues
- Creates a stub for Excel dependency to fix missing package errors
- Runs database commands with increased memory limits
- Handles migration failures gracefully with detailed error reporting
- Verifies database tables after migration

These tools work together to ensure reliable database setup even in environments with limited PHP versions or constrained resources.

## Future Improvements
