# Simple Fix for Faveo URL Redirect Issues on Railway

This document provides a straightforward solution to fix the URL redirect issues in Faveo Helpdesk on Railway.

## The Problem

When deployed on Railway, Faveo may redirect from the main URL (e.g., `https://vibe-faveo-production.up.railway.app`) to a URL with port 8080 (e.g., `https://vibe-faveo-production.up.railway.app:8080/public/`).

## The Fix

We've created an all-in-one solution that addresses all the issues in a single deployment:

1. **Updated Dockerfile**: Modified to use our complete bootstrap script
2. **Consolidated bootstrap-complete.sh**: Contains all fixes in a single file

## How to Deploy This Fix

1. Just push these changes to your GitHub repository:
```bash
git add bootstrap-complete.sh Dockerfile SIMPLE-FIX.md
git commit -m "036 Complete fix for URL redirect issues"
git push origin master
```

2. Railway will automatically detect the changes and redeploy your application with the fixes.

## What This Fix Does

The fix automatically:

1. Detects the correct application URL from Railway environment variables
2. Updates URL settings in the database
3. Updates the .env file with the correct APP_URL
4. Creates a config override file
5. Creates a bootstrap file to be included at application startup
6. Patches the index.php file to include the bootstrap file
7. Configures Apache to prevent port issues in URLs
8. Clears all Laravel caches

## Verification

After deployment, verify that:
1. Your app doesn't redirect to a URL with port 8080
2. Admin panel links work correctly
3. The application settings show the correct URL

## Troubleshooting

If you still have issues:
1. Check Railway deployment logs for errors
2. Verify that your MySQL service is properly linked to your app
3. Make sure your GitHub repository is linked to Railway for automatic deployment
